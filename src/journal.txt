The Beginning of the Journey...

I set out on the journey of making a personal website for CS410. 
This wouldnt be the first personal website I have create but I really
wanted to make it something I am proud of and want to share with others.

I began by figuring out what I wanted my webpage to look like. I chose my 
color scheme and basic layout and begin to create a barebones webpage.

Since I am wanting to go into Cybersecurity, i wanted to go for a very simple
monotype based webpage. Although it is a very simple plan, it can be hard to visually 
nail down and make perfect. I plan to use bootstrap or CSS grids at the moment
to allow compatibility in different browser sizes. But this will be for a later day. 

When choosing my colors, i used https://coolors.co/ to ensure the colors 
would look good together and also that they were accessible for people who
are color blind. This site will show you what the site looks like for the many
different types of color blindness and it really helped me better visualize it. 
Since I was going for a hackereque look I could have gone with the basic black and 
green like most webpages I have seen to basically mimic a terminal window. But 
instead i chose to add a personal touch of using my favorite color, blue, and then 
made the background a softer dark grey. This should open the webpage up a bit more in
terms of viewing. 

In the future, I have though about the potential to add a light/dark mode since 
this has been a very popular trend recently with the most recent OS on both mac and PC, 
but i have not quite looked into how to implement this. I assume it will involve JS or React. 

After picking the colors and having a general idea of a them, i created a bare barebones
html webpage and made sure it was functional. I then continued by adding a css page and added
font that i chose from googles open source font webpage as well as added my colors as variables
in the stylesheet. 

I then began to tackle the task of a basic nav bar.
